# Budget

simple budgeting app that checks you into foursquare/swarm at the same time

Currently working on DB support w/ realm for Expense entries and a basic UI for adding them. 

Then adding foursquare checkin ability

then cleaning it all up so you can view your list of transactions by month

and that should be v1. 

After that, better visualizations, maybe buy parakeet icons for it?
